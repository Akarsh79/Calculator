# Calculator
Here is my First Project that is a Custom Calcultor that performs Addition,Subtraction,Multiplication and Division Operation.
# 🔢 Java CLI Calculator

A simple **command-line calculator** application written in Java using a modular structure. This project demonstrates basic object-oriented programming and user input handling in Java.

> 🛠️ Language: Java  
> 🎯 Goal: Practice control flow, input/output, and modular design

 🚀 Features

- ✅ Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- ✅ Modular class separation (`Calculate` for logic, `Calculator` for UI)
- ✅ Menu-driven interface with user input loop
- ✅ Input validation (e.g., no divide-by-zero crashes)
